# Solidity-Gas-Optimizoor

An high performance automated CLI tool that optimizes gas usage in Solidity smart contracts, focusing on storage and function call efficiency.

For more information on architecture and implementation, see the [docs](docs.md)

**Problem Statement:**

Solidity developers need tools to help them write gas-efficient code to minimize the execution cost of smart contracts on the blockchain. While there are some linters and optimizers available, there's a lack of tools specifically designed to analyze and suggest optimizations at both the source code and intermediate representation levels.

**Project Objective:**

The goal of this project is to design and implement a Rust-based tool that analyzes Solidity smart contracts, identifies patterns that lead to high gas usage, and suggests or automatically applies optimizations to improve gas efficiency.

## How does our tool optimize the gas of your smart contracts?

### Structured Data Packing

- **Concept**: Aligning struct members under 32 bytes together optimizes storage usage on the EVM.
- **Advantages**: This technique minimizes the number of `SLOAD` or `SSTORE` operations, slashing storage interaction costs by 50% or more when dealing with multiple struct values within a single slot.
- **Tooling**: A Rust CLI application scrutinizes Solidity struct layouts, reorganizing fields to use fewer storage slots. It respects existing comments and assumes `bytes32` for unrecognized types.

### Caching Storage Variables

- **Approach**: Utilize local variables to cache frequently accessed storage variables, reducing the number of expensive storage reads and writes.
- **Details**: Create a temporary local variable to store the value of a storage variable if it's accessed multiple times.

### Calldata Efficiency

- **Gas Savings**: Leveraging calldata for unaltered external function inputs is more cost-effective than utilizing memory.
- **Implementation**: Analyze functions to ensure that inputs declared as `memory` are not modified. If unmodified, convert to `calldata`.
